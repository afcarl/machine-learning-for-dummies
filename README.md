# Machine Learning for Dummies

This article series can be seen as a developer's guide to
learning everything about Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning.

The series will teach everything in programming terms and
try to avoid stupid Maths wherever possible.

There's also an accompanying article series on Medium -
though as Medium has not so good code integration capabilities
it is recommended to use this repository for reference.

Each chapter also has an `/example` folder that contains
the final project that the reader has to build to complete
the chapter for itself.

The philosophy of this article series is mostly something
along the lines of "If you haven't coded it, you probably
talk bullshit anyways.".

So the reader is highly encouraged to code, build practical
projects and to find mistakes my code :)


# Chapter 1

1. [Introduction](./chapter-01/00-intro.md)
2. [Neural Network Basics](./chapter-01/01-neural-network-basics.md)
3. [Activation Function](./chapter-01/02-activation-function.md)
4. [Feed-Forward Network](./chapter-01/03-feed-forward-network.md)
5. [Example (Homework)](./chapter-01/04-example.md)

# Chapter 2

REFACTOR TBD. This chapter will guide the reader through
the advantages of evolutionary / competitive concepts and
evolutionary (unsupervised) learning in general and the
idea of generational knowledge models.
