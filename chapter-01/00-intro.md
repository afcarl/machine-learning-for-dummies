# Machine Learning for Dummies: Chapter 1

I often get asked on how to get started with Machine
Learning. Most of the time, people have troubles
understanding the maths behind all things. And I have
to admit, I don't like the maths either. Math is an
abstract way of describing things. And I think the way
Machine Learning is described is too abstract to
understand it easily.

So in this article series I probably try to describe
things with foo code or a bit of JS to explain what
I'm talking about.

The first thing you have to know is that there are
different concepts that allow different solutions.

I will dig into the more complex solutions later
when you're ready for them. The problems are mostly
divided in time-sensitive data (RNNs and RNN LSTMs),
visual or pixel-related data (CNNs) and simple
vectorized data (BNNs, BNs, BNNs and QNNs).

However, there are more complex architectures around
from the engineering and biological perspective; and
I think they're a quite powerful toolset to know - as
they can be freely combined with "low-level" machine
learning solutions.

Explanation of all those concepts would be too much
right now, as most of them have other - more
coincidental - use cases in other areas like NLP,
parsing complex texts or describing artistic paintings.

I'm also trying not to be language specific and neither
framework specific here. The demo codes are written in
simple ES2017+ JavaScript, so you can easily try them
out in node.js and the Web Browser (Chrome recommended)
and fiddle with the demos to your liking.

The first topic I'll cover in this article is the raw
basics of Neural Networks, Genetic Programming and
Evolution.
